# Object-Oriented-Programming
The following repo consists of a series of Java and C++ programs that I covered up during my 4th semester of BTech. The programs cover a wide range of concepts and paradigms related to Object Oriented Programming.
There are two separate folders, one for C++ and one for Java. Just open the folder using VS Code and you access all the files. Also the output files are provided with the same, so on running the code, it shall prompt the terminal directly without having the need to create the output file again..!!
